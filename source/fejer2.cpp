	function [z,q] = fejer2(n)

	Weights q and nodes z for the n-point Fejer type-2 quadrature rules,
	calculated via the inverse (fast) real_t discrete fourier transform.

	The knots are the same knots as the Clenshaw-Curtis knots, implying that
	by doubling the number of evalulation points, you can re-use the function
	evaluations at the old points, since the new set of knots will contain the
	old set of knots. In other words, the knots for an n-point fejer2 rule
	will be contained in the (2*n+1)-point fejer2 rule.
 
	Although capable of computing knots and weights for arbitrary 'n', the
	computation will be much faster and efficient if (n+1) has factors only
	from the set from the integer_t set {2,3,4,5}.
	
	Therefore one recommended sequence of n is {3,7,15,31,63,127,255,511,1023,...}.
	Three (or five) times this set would also be acceptable.

	Given an interval [a,b] and a domain_type, this subroutine maps the interval [-1,1] to [a,b],
	an interval that may be closed, left-infinite, right-infinite, or totally infinite.
 
	The input points are x, and should be enclosed in the open interval (-1:1). This restriction is NOT checked for.
 
	On output, the points y are the mapped points to the new interval, and the dy array gives the derivative of the transformation.
 
	Note that the change of integration variables is $\int_{-1}^{+1} f(x) \, dx = \int_{a}^{b} f(y(x)) dy \, dx$, and this is
	used in the quadrature approximations to integration.
